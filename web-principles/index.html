    <p>Awesome things about HTML</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It changed the Internet</li>
        <li>It's fun to play with</li>
        <li>It still works!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Terrible things about HTML</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Takes a long time to learn</li>
      <li>Requires a lot of attention</li>
      <li>Not powerful enough on its own</li>
    </ol>

    <p>HTML is an essential skillset for web developers to understand and master because HTML is the backbone of the web. There are CSS- and JS-only solutions that enable you to create a page with no HTML, but in order to truly understand CSS or JS, one must be adept at HTML. </p>
    
    <p>HTML is a markup language used to structure your page, and is where all of the content of your page lies, with default CSS structuring its style. Changing the style requires some knowledge of CSS, but you could still create a functional page with strictly HTML. </p>
    
    <p>HTML drastically changed the world, and the way we all communicate. Without HTML, social networks wouldn’t be a thing, all stores and businesses would have to be brick and mortar, and we probably wouldn’t have known what to do if we entered a socially distancing pandemic with no remote access to our friends, education or occupation. </p>
